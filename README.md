## ðŸ§  Why It Was Built

Time Keeper was born out of a need for a **lightweight, bloat free, no-login time tracker**.

There are plenty of powerful tools out there, but sometimes you just want to **track work and move on** - that's where this app shines.

2. Run it â€” no installation required
3. Select or add a task
4. Start, pause, or end your timer
5. Logs are saved to `Task_Timer.xlsx` in the same folder
